CS 6475: Computational Photography had a mix of code and research for projects.

	PROJECT  1: A Photograph is a Photograph - Very basic, Install VM for class
		    and provide and describe a picture. No Code.
*	PROJECT  2: Image I/O and Python Set-up - Very basic image processing,
		    Count pixels, Average pixels, Convert to black and white,
		    Blend (merge) images, Flip image. Minimal Python code.
	PROJECT  3: Epsilon Photography. No Code.
*****	PROJECT  4: Gradients and Edges. Challenging Python code for edge detection
		    and Image Rasterization. Good examples using Numpy slicing.
	PROJECT  5: Camera Obscura. Pinhole camera. No code.
***	PROJECT  6: Blending. Moderate Python code.
***	PROJECT  7: Feature Detection and Matching.  Moderate Python code.
****	PROJECT  8: Panoramas. Moderate(+) Python code.
****	PROJECT  9: High Dynamic Range (HDR). Moderate(+) Python code.
	PROJECT 10: Photosynth and Panorama (Photoshop), No Code.
***	PROJECT 11: Video Textures. Moderate Python code. FFmpeg.
		    GIMP - GNU Image Manipulation Program.

	===================================================
*****	PROJECT Final: Video Textures. Edge Detection. Blending. Challenging Python code.
	PROJECT Portfolio: Compilation of course work.
