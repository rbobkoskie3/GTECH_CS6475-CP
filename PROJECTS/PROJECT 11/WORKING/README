HOW TO RUN: Open and run 'assignment11_test.py'. Be sure to include the directory 'videos',
and the code 'assignment11.py' in the same WORKING directory as 'assignment11_test.py'.

NOTE: Generating test output. (This could take a while.)


================================================
// Results: Car @10fps with 75 ms delay:

STEP 1:	Frames were extracted from an mp4 video that captures a toy car being pulled in one
	cycle (back/forth) by myself and a friend. I tied thread to the axles of the car, and
	my friend pulled forward and I pulled it back. There is a jerking motion of my friends
	hand that was also captured that lends another form of unintended motion to the video.
	I used an iPhone mounted behind the scene to take the video.

STEP 2:	Frames were extracted (10fps) from the mp4 with ffmpeg:
	ffmpeg -i C:\PYCODE\CS6475\IMAGES\20160629_100145.mp4 -vf fps=10 C:\PYCODE\CS6475\RESIZE\%03d.png

STEP 3:	I then used the asssignment11 code to create a textured video from these frames.

STEP 4:	The final step was to create a gif from the textured video. I used gimp to construct a gif by opening up
	all the images generated from assignment11.py and exporting as a gif. I was able to adjust the delay
	between frames to 75 ms, and set to an infinite loop. This gave me a good result.
